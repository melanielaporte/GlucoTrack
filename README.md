# UX Research Case Study

## Project Overview
The GlucoTrack Dashboard was designed to help individuals with diabetes visualize and act on their glucose data. The goal was to simplify health monitoring through a user-centered, intuitive design that could cater to a wide demographic of users, including those with varying levels of tech literacy.

## Research Objective
To understand how users interact with health dashboards and identify features that enhance usability, engagement, and actionable insights.

## Research Process
1. Stakeholder Interviews
- Conducted interviews with healthcare providers and diabetes patients to identify pain points in current glucose monitoring tools.
- Key insight: Users wanted quick, actionable insights without overwhelming data displays.
2. Competitive Analysis
- Analyzed popular health apps to identify best practices in dashboard design and areas for improvement.
- Key finding: Overly complex dashboards led to disengagement.
3. User Surveys
- Distributed surveys to 50 individuals managing diabetes to understand their needs.
- Highlighted user needs: Simplified trends visualization, customizable notifications, and integration with wearable devices.
4. Usability Testing
- Tested low- and high-fidelity prototypes with 12 participants.
- Gathered feedback: Users appreciated the clear data visualization but requested additional customization options.

## Design Solutions
- Data visualizations -> Developed graphs showing real-time and historical glucose trends with customizable time frames.
- Daily summaries -> Provided users with digestible summaries of their health metrics to reduce cognitive load.
- Customizable alerts -> Designed notification settings to allow users to prioritize their unique health goals.

## Results
